# Exploratory Data Analysis for Credit Risk Assessment
This project focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques in a real-world business context, specifically in the banking and financial services sector. The goal is to explore and analyze customer data to gain insights into credit risk, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions and minimize the risk of financial loss.

## Business Context
Loan providers often struggle with applicants lacking sufficient credit history, increasing the risk of defaults. This analysis aims to uncover how customer and loan attributes influence default likelihood, helping reduce financial losses while ensuring eligible borrowers aren't unnecessarily rejected.

## Approach
 1. Data Acquisition
 2. Data Cleaning
 3. Data Analysis 
 4.  Data Visualization 
 5.  Project Report

## Project Goals
1. Understand applicant profiles and loan behavior
2. Analyze default patterns using historical loan application data
3. Support data-driven decisions to balance business growth and risk management

## Dataset Includes:
1. Loan status: approved, cancelled, refused, unused offer
2. Customer repayment behavior (e.g., late payments)
3. Loan and client attributes

## Conclusion
 In conclusion, the insights gathered from this project shed light on
 various aspects of loan applicants' characteristics and behaviors. The
 analysis of income totals revealed the presence of outliers, indicating
 individuals with significantly higher incomes compared to the majority.
 This highlights the importance of considering income disparity when
 assessing borrower risk and tailoring financial products to cater to
 different income levels
